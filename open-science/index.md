# Open-science

I am committed to implement open-science practices (software, data, documentation) for my research and education, particularly for the development of open-source software projects in geophysics, all of which are accessible through my GitHub profile ([github.com/sgkang](https://github.com/sgkang)). Some of major projects include:

## Fastpath ([fastpath.stanford.edu](https://fastpath.stanford.edu))

Fastpath is a web-based platform that provides seamless access to public geophysical data and scientific analytic tools, enabling practitioners to assess suitable areas for groundwater recharge.

## SimPEG ([www.simpeg.xyz](https://www.simpeg.xyz))

SimPEG includes a suite of geophysical methods including magnetics, gravity, ERT (or DC resistivity), EM, magnetotellurics (MT).

## EM GeoSci ([em.geosci.xyz](https://em.geosci.xyz))

Online textbook for electromagnetic geophysics.

## Geophysics for Practicing Geophysicists ([gpg.geosci.xyz](https://gpg.geosci.xyz))

Online textbook for applied geophysics.
